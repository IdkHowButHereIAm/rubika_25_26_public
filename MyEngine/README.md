# MyEngine

The purpose of this project is to implement a tiny 2D engine using SFML to practice C++, to think about engine architecture, how to solve issues...

### Resources

Here are useful links:
- [SFML doc](https://www.sfml-dev.org/documentation/2.6.2/)
- [ImGui ](https://pthom.github.io/imgui_manual_online/)

## Threshold 0

The purpose of this threshold is to (re)learn how to use SFML. You will have to draw sprites using resources that are provided (or the ones you like). Spawn several sprites which use the same texture.
